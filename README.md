Brain_Tumor_Detection_and_Classification

This is a system which can detect the drowsiness of the driver using CNN - Python, YOLOv8

The increasing global burden of brain tumors, coupled with the limitations of current diagnostic methods, underscores a critical need for more accurate, timely, and accessible detection tools. Conventional imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans, while effective, often rely on manual interpretation and are susceptible to delays and human error. As brain tumors continue to present significant challenges in terms of early diagnosis and treatment, there is an urgent demand for more sophisticated diagnostic tools. This research investigates the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically utilizing the YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once) model, in enhancing brain tumor detection accuracy and efficiency.

Here, we used YOLOv8, an advanced deep learning model, leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify tumors from medical images with high precision. By analyzing vast datasets of labeled brain tumor images, YOLO8 is capable of identifying gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors, and other abnormalities with superior speed and accuracy compared to traditional image processing techniques. The model's ability to localize tumors in real-time enables clinicians to make more informed decisions, leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.
